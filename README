lognet is a set of simple logging classes for dotNET.

It was originally written for version 2.0 of the framework, but should work on
later versions. I haven't tested it on 1.0 or 1.1

Usage is designed to be really simple. You can configure it by adding something
like the following to your program:

LogNet.DebugLogger.AppName = "MyApp"
LogNet.DebugLogger.Threshold = LogNet.LoggingLevels.Informational
LogNet.DebugLogger.Enabled = True
LogNet.ErrorLogger.AppName = "MyApp"

This sets everything to be logged into the files MyApp.log and MyApp.err in your
"My Documents" folder.

You can then use lines like the following to record stuff.

LogNet.DebugLogger.LogAction("ReplyHandler.GotReply", _
                             reply.ToString(), _
                             Logging.LoggingLevels.Informational)

to log an item in the .log file. Or something like:

catch (exception ex) {
    LogNet.ErrorLogger.LogError(ex, Logging.DisplayOption.OnlyIfLogged)
}

to record details of an exception in the .err file.
